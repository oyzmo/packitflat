"""Turn Cargo.lock into the flatpak sources list for an offline cargo build.

This is a stdlib-only stand-in for flatpak-builder-tools' flatpak-cargo-generator.py.
That script pulls in aiohttp and toml, neither of which is packaged here by
default, and it needs both only for git dependencies -- it has to clone the repo
and read its Cargo.toml to work out the crate names. Pack It Flat has no git
dependencies: every entry in Cargo.lock is a crates.io registry crate whose
tarball URL and sha256 are already in the lock file. So the whole job is a
transcription, and tomllib (stdlib since 3.11) is enough to do it.

If a git dependency is ever added, this refuses to guess and says to use the
upstream generator instead.
